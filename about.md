A little about me. My first web development job was for London Agency [Tui](http://www.tui.co.uk) back in 2001. Back then clients we're BT, The Halifax and Asda. I learned my trade here and focussed on the backend. 

Since then I've built many projects ranging from small brochure sites to full blown content management systems for global brands like Wagamama. I've been a senior developer a number of agencies including [Engage Interactive](http://www.engageinteractive.co.uk) who are based in Leeds and work as a consultant and developer on a freelance basis for [Hype Type](http://hypetype.co.uk), [Humaan](http://humaan.com) and [Bluestone98](http://bluestone98.com).

I've been involved in all aspects of project development from planning through to development, deployment and performance tweaking. I'm as happy in the back end as I am in the front end. 

I don't want to list everything I can do here but I'm comfortable with most aspects of web development. I offer full stack development, in Ruby (Ror) / PHP (Custom / Magento / Wordpress) and front end work CSS (Sass, Less) / HTML5 / Javascript (Jquery / Backbone). I'm also experienced at writing a technical spec's and pitching.
