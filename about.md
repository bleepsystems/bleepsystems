A little about me. My first web development job was for London Agency [Tui](http://www.tui.co.uk) back in 2001. Back then clients we're BT, The Halifax and Asda. I learned my trade here and focussed on the backend. 

Since then I've built hundreds of projects ranging from small brochure sites to full blown content management systems for global brands like Wagamama. I've been a senior developer a number of agencies including [Engage Interactive](http://www.engageinteractive.co.uk) who are also based in Leeds. I've been involved in all aspects of project development from planning through to full stack development. I'm as happy in the back end as I am in the front end. 

I was a consultant at [Bluestone 98](http://bluestone98.com) for a year and helped with Digital Strategy. 

I offer full stack development, in Ruby (Ror) / PHP / Javascript and front end work using CSS (Less, Sass) / HTML5.
